**Hello, and welcome!** I am a Research Fellow on Genetics (Cancer) with [Genetics and Regenerative Medicine Research Centre (GRMRC)](https://grmrc.org) of the Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) and the [Malaysia Genome Institute (MGI)](https://mgi-nibm.my/v5/index.php). My work in basic and translational research is focused on developing targeted therapy for human bladder cancer with primary focus on cancer genomics and transcriptomics through bioinformatics analyses of next-generation sequence (NGS) data such as transcriptome (RNA-Seq) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. 

My scientific interests focus on transcriptional and genomics profiling of cancer through high-throughput sequencing technologies. His work primarily deciphered the genetic components that regulate the molecular pathways and networks underlying the development of persistent infection in bladder cancer through the use of an oncolytic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) to mediate cellular oncolysis.
